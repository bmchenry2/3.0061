  ### Week 7

  ##### _Monday, October 17_

  On Monday, we learned how to use Fusion360 to make sketches of parts and of the reflection of sunlight. 

  ##### _Wednesday, October 19_

  On Wednesday, we tested different reflecting materials to decide how we can improve our efficiency of our final product. We tested a strip of steel, 2 types of reflective tape, a coated material, an acrylic piece used in our reflector, and a piece of the box solar cooker from previous weeks. We set them outside and recorded initial temps, all of which were around 20 or 21 degrees. 

  We tilted the foam board that the samples were on towards the sky to measure how well the samples reflected the temperature of the sky; good reflectors would be ones that had similar temps to the sky, and poor reflectors would be ones that were warmer than the sky. 

  Of our 6 samples, the best reflectors were the 2 reflective tape types and the steel strip. The coated material, the acrylic piece, and the piece of the box solar cooker were all very poor reflectors.
