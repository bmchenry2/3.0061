  ### About Me

  Hi there! My name is Brittany McHenry. I'm a sophomore course 2A in the NEET CSS track.

  I was interested in NEET because of the hands-on experiences and the small group collaboration on projects that address real world problems. I was initially accepted into the Material Machines track before the CSS merging.

  When I'm not doing homework or working, I love to play soccer. I'm on the club soccer team at MIT, and every Monday and Wednesday we have practice with games most weekends. I'm also a member of Cru, the non-denominational Christian group on campus, and I also go to some TCC (Tech Catholic Council) events, namely their spaghetti dinner every Friday (known affectionately as Spags!)
