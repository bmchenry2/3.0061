  ### Week 14

  ##### _Monday, December 12_

  It's go time! All groups worked on finishing touches and assembly. Our group was basically done with machining and design work after printing the last bracket, so we began finishing putting together the bounce mirror and reflector.

  After attaching the last bracket, Noah cut 1/4-20 threaded rods into three 2-foot segments. Xavier and I tapped each of the three brackets that would hold a rod. After some filing on the ends of the rods, we screwed all the rods into the brackets. We then inserted the rods into the holes of the bounce mirror frame and aligned the frame ~22 inches from the top of the reflector to make sure that the face of the bounce mirror was close to 21 inches. The frame was kept in place by sandwiching bolts.

  Here is our completed reflector structure!

  We also took it outside to do some very informal heat radiance testing:

  After we were done with the reflector, we helped out with the assembly of the base of the cooker. We discovered some critical misalignments with the parts, so we did our best to make adjustments where needed. We had gotten to the point where the gears for the rotation degree of freedom were put into place before I left.

  It's presentation day!

  We all did last minute adjustments and then went to Anna's slideshow to work on our slides. The two guests came, and we spent about an hour talking to them about the progress we made and how the cooker worked.

  We also talked amongst ourselves of the limitations of our design. A few limitations were the flimsiness of the reflector itself and the light scattering of the reflective surface. If we had more time, we would have liked to bolster the reflector by adding a support ring around it or by using a stiffer plastic for the pieces. The light scattering was unexpected, but it may be the result of the tape we used or the pebbled texture of the plastic pieces; we would have liked to do some further testing of materials and perhaps explored manufacturing options with less consequent imperfections, such as sanding the mold or using a thicker plastic type. The tracking mechanism was also in need of adjustment, particularly the rotating degree of freedom. Extra time would have likely allowed the tracking team to make a more functional and less temperamental mechanism.

  Overall, I think we did a good job in addressing the negative aspects of last year's cooker! Our version still isn't perfect, but I think our ideas have potential. I'm excited to see if it's actually functional and if it can make nachos next semester :)
