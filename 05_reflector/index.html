  ### Week 5: Building the Fresnel Reflector 

  ##### _Monday, October 3_

  With the weather taking a turn for the worse, we returned to working on the specific components of our prototype cooker. Noah, Xavier, and I returned to laser cutting the rest of the reflector pieces, and we also taped them to the foam stand. We finished all but one row of the reflector.

  ##### _Wednesday, October 5_

  We finished the laser cutting of the reflector pieces, so we then turned to the moving mechanism for the cooker. We went down to 3-001 to learn how to use the 3D printers, and we began the printing of the remaining parts. A few of us (me included) were assigned to begin the assemblage of the moving mechanism.

  The finished reflector looks like this:
