  ### Week 11

  ##### _Monday, November 14_

  We went back to Fusion360 and worked on the CAD model for that would be the mold for thermo-forming the reflector pieces. We had to shell the bottom of the piece and add supports to aid in the thermo-forming process. Thermo-forming doesn't like edges, so we also ensured that the final part would have smooth transitions between the sides of the supports with an added slope.

  Here is the final mold for each of the 6 reflector pieces:

  With the mold done, we discussed toolpaths for milling. Justin showed us his way of creating the tool paths in Fusion360. Then, we  brainstormed ideas for the secondary mirror. I thought that we should just use the same curvature as the main reflector and adjust the diameter of the bounce mirror to be ~6 inches.

  Since we are planning on using drills and screws for connections, we learned from Justin what the imperial and metric system for threaded rods and screws are; we are planning on using 1/4 - 20 rods for the supporting rods of the secondary mirror. The nomenclature means that there are 20 threads per inch on the rod, and the rod is 1/4 inch in diameter.
