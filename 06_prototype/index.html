  ### Week 6 

  ##### _Wednesday, October 12_

  We took the reflector outside to see if this one panel would make water boil. We left the setup outside for about 60 minutes.

  The temperature rose quickly in the first half of the experiment, but the rate decreased soon after and the temperature soon plateaued. The sun was going down, so the intensity of the solar radiation was lessening; additionally, the building's shadow was creeping up to the reflector, which would have also blocked out some solar energy and decreased the reflector's efficiency.
