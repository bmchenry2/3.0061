  ### Week 12

  ##### _Monday, November 21_

  Noah was out of town this week, so Xavier and I worked on the coupling part that would have a double purpose: to support the rods that hold the secondary reflector and to assist in rotating the reflector. I was struggling to make a part, but Xavier successfully made a draft part.

  ##### _Wednesday, November 23_

  Noah, Xavier, and Justin were out today, so Nathan and I discussed what could be done so as to not waste a day of work. We decided to try to print out the coupling parts for the reflector, so I went into Xavier's CAD model for the part and added holes. One hole at the top would be the hold for the rod, a front hole would allow for rotation, and 4 holes on the side would allow each side of a reflector piece to be held together with screws. We then went to the 3D printers and began a print on the part.

  Here's the part:
