  ### Week 9

  ##### _Monday, October 31_

  We completed applying the reflective tape onto the panels of the Fresnel reflector, and we made a secondary reflector from the center of the main one. We took the setup outside to verify our focal lengths.

  We had an interesting discovery about the focal lengths. Our main reflector maintained a focal length of approximately 1m, which was expected from prior calculations. However, we came across an issue in that once we established the length of the main reflector and added the secondary reflector to see the bounce-back, we couldn't find the bounce-back. After some troubleshooting, we discovered that the focal length of the secondary reflector was 6 inches, which was significantly shorter than that of the main reflector. 
   

  ##### _Wednesday, November 2_

  We set decided to test the best reflective materials from the prior week to compare to tinfoil and a new gold film. We retested the 2 reflective tapes and added swatches of tin foil (dull and shiny sides out) and one piece of gold foil.
