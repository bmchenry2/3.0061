  ### Week 14

  ##### _Monday, December 5_

  We commenced with thermo-forming the 6 pieces for the reflector. We centered our wooden mold on the screen of the machine. We then moved the screen to the bottom of the machine and placed a plastic sheet on the top. We pulled the heater over the plastic and waited ~90 seconds for the plastic to soften, after which we moved the heater away, inflated the plastic sheet, pushed the mold upward, and sucked the air from under the plastic. Once we observed the plastic was flat to the wood, we blew air over it to help it cool down faster. Once cooled, we pushed the mold up to pop it out of the plastic, and lo and behold--a plastic impression of the mold was left! We repeated this process 6 times for 6 pieces, and took them to a workshop for cutting and shaping. We were able to cut and shape 4 pieces, so we will complete the process later.
